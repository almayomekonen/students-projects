Fullstack Projects by Almayo Mekonen and his students!

Welcome to the fullstack projects repository! Those projects is the culmination of the skills and concepts I've taught my students as part of my work at Methodian and during my time teaching at Aardvark Israel.

About Me
Iâ€™m Almayo Mekonen, a full-stack web developer with a strong focus on creating meaningful learning experiences. As an educator, I have had the privilege of teaching full-stack development to students in a hands-on, project-based environment. I've been fortunate to share my expertise in a diverse, international community through my work at Aardvark Israel and Methodian.

At Aardvark Israel, I taught students how to build real-world applications. the Students experienced different sides of Israeli culture, gained work experience through internships, and developed lifelong skills while learning full-stack development.

What is Aardvark Israel?
Aardvark Israel offers a unique gap year program that combines structured learning and personal growth. Students live in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, immerse themselves in Israeli culture, volunteer, intern, and even earn college credits. The program fosters a sense of independence while providing a strong support system.

Projects Overview
This repository includes full-stack projects that I have guided my students through. These projects cover various aspects of web development, from back-end to front-end, and are designed to provide students with the practical skills needed for a career in tech.

Each project follows a comprehensive curriculum where students:

1) Learn the fundamentals of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2) Dive into back-end technologies using Node.js and Express
3) Build and integrate APIs
4) Work with databases (MongoDB, SQL)
5) Deploy their applications online

Values of This Projects
1) Learning by Doing: Every project encourages students to apply what they've learned in real-world scenarios.
2) International Collaboration: Students from around the world work together, exchanging ideas and growing their networks.
3) Personal Growth: The projects aim to build both technical and personal development skills, just as the Aardvark program did for many students.
